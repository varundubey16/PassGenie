# Flask Speech Recognition App

This is a simple Flask-based web application that provides speech recognition functionality. It processes speech from the user's microphone and converts it into text. Additionally, the recognized text is read aloud using text-to-speech synthesis.

## Requirements

To run this app, you will need to install the following Python packages:

- **sklearn**: For machine learning functionalities
- **tensorflow**: For AI-based speech processing models
- **numpy**: For numerical operations
- **flask**: For the web framework

**Note**: This app may be slow on low-end computers, as it uses TensorFlow and other computationally intensive libraries. It performs much better on machines with a GPU for processing.

### Installation

 Just download, go inside the folder and run python app.py, after you have run pip installs of all above mentioned
